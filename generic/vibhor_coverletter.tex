\textbf{Subject}: Application for Visiting researcher in robotics \\ \\
 %TODO: Enter the name after salutation
\opening{Dear Prof. Zhou,}

 %TODO: Enter the name of company and position
I am writing to express my interest in contributing to the \textit{University of Macau} as a \textit{Visiting researcher in robotics}.

 %TODO: Enter the name of company and position
As I consider the next phase of my career after several years in Germany, I have been reflecting on where I can contribute the most meaningfully. I am interested in your vision of RL/ML and imitation learning in robotics. With AI capturing our world digitally, it will not be time when it strikes the physical world of robotics. I would like to be part of its impact on the industry.

I am currently a software engineer at Bosch Group (ETAS) with over six years of experience in automotive and robotics. I completed my bachelor's degree as a mechanical engineer with a minor in applied mathematics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India, and a master's degree in automotive engineering from RWTH Aachen, Germany. I have worked for international robotics and automotive research laboratories and companies in Germany, India, and Italy. You can find more details on the attached \href{https://vibhoraggarwal.github.io/files/VibhorResume_en.pdf}{resume}.

Since my undergraduate studies, where I had the opportunity to work on an off-road vehicle, I have developed a deep passion for the dynamics of machine systems. I have gained significant experience in automation, humanoid robotics, and ADAS systems. During my tenure at ETAS/Bosch, I collaborated with cross-functional teams and worked closely with stakeholders and customers to drive the success of ADAS technologies, such as simulation models and middleware.

Drawing on my experience, I have worked and am fluent in the following domains among others which might be helpful for the position:
\begin{itemize}
  \item System Design \& Integration
  \item (Rapid) prototyping of systems
  \item Control engineering
  \item Agile software development
  \item Robot dynamics and motion
  \item Hands on experience with \href{https://icub.iit.it/}{iCub Humanoid robot}
  \item Continuous delivery systems
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Mention your work location:
I am currently based in Germany but will be open to relocate. Currently, I am looking for a short term position of upto 6 months.
% TODO: Mention the additional questions being asked from you in the position information, like visa requirements, salary requirements, nationality
% Following are personal details asked in the job posting:\\
%\textbf{Nationality}: Indian\\
%\textbf{Visa requirements}: I already have a study visa in Germany, but I would require a visa to work in Belgium as well.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I would be happy to provide any further information and be available for a discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you.
